#' @title Two proportion z-test
#' @description Uses z distribution to test for statistical equality of two proportions
#' @usage prop.z.test(x, n, p = NULL, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
#' conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE, case_col = 1)
#' @param x a vector of length two, providing count
#' of "successes" or "outcomes of interest" for
#' either group or a two-dimensional table (or matrix)
#' with 2 columns, giving the counts of successes and
#' failures, respectively.
#' @param n a vector of length two for counts of trials/observations in either group;
#' ignored if x is a matrix or a table.
#' @param p a vector of length two representing the expected probability
#' of "success" in either group. The vector's elements must be greater than 0 and less than 1.
#' @param alternative a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default),
#' "greater" or "less". You can specify just the initial letter. Only used for testing the null that a single proportion equals
#' a given value, or that two proportions are equal; ignored otherwise.
#' @param conf.level confidence level of the returned confidence interval. Must be a single number between 0 and 1.
#' Only used when testing the null that a single proportion equals a given value, or that two proportions are equal; ignored otherwise.
#' @param correct a logical indicating whether Yates' continuity correction should be applied where possible.
#' @param case_col if x is a table or matrix, a single integer for the index of the column in which cases appear
#' @details Takes a 2x2 table object where default is that cases appear in the first column and counts
#' of the exposed appear in the second row.
#'
#' Only groups with finite numbers of successes and failures are used. Counts of
#' successes and failures must be nonnegative and hence not greater than the corresponding
#' numbers of trials which must be positive. All finite counts should be integers.
#'
#' If p is NULL and there is more than one group, the null tested is that the proportions in
#' each group are the same. If there are two groups, the alternatives are that the probability
#' of success in the first group is less than, not equal to, or greater than the probability of
#' success in the second group, as specified by alternative. A confidence interval for the
#' difference of proportions with confidence level as specified by conf.level and clipped to {-1,1} is returned.
