# epiAssist
A package with functions designed to help R beginners with superfluous programming tasks involved with Biostat 705 Lab

## Welcome, lonesome traveler!

If you've somehow made it to this site, I can only imagine what you must be doing with your time.
I specifically created this package so that you wouldn't have to go digging around for things as you
complete the Labs for this semester. Or, at least, not so much.

But alas, here we are and I think I've been discovered.

Don't tell Larry.
